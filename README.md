# Breast-cancer-prediction
The "Breast-cancer-prediction" project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of breast cancer being benign or malignant. It employs decision tree, random forest, and linear regression models for classification and prediction tasks. The project focuses on preprocessing cancer-related data, training models to identify patterns, and evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy. The goal is to create an effective, automated tool for early detection of breast cancer, which can aid in better diagnosis and treatment planning.
